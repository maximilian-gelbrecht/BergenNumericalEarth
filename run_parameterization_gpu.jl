# # Running the learned parameterization on the GPU
#
# The column-wise `LearnedSurfaceRoughness` from `parameterization.jl` is not
# GPU-compatible: all columns share a single input buffer (a data race in a
# parallel kernel) and `Lux.apply` of a full `Chain` cannot be called from
# inside a GPU kernel. On the GPU, SpeedyWeather fuses all column
# parameterizations into one kernel over the grid points, so the network would
# have to run per-point inside that kernel.
#
# SpeedyWeather offers a second kind of parameterization for exactly this
# situation: a [global parameterization](https://speedyweather.github.io/SpeedyWeatherDocumentation/dev/parameterizations).
# It is called once per time step with the complete state — and is expected to
# organise its own computation (e.g. launch its own kernels). That is a perfect
# match for a neural network: we gather the inputs of *all* grid points into one
# `(7, npoints)` matrix, evaluate the network batched in a single
# `Lux.apply`, and write the result back with array broadcasts.
