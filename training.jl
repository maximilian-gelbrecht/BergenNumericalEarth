# 
# First, we define our training loop. The loop includes an early stopping based

# training and validation set that is saved to CSV file for later plotting. 
#
# We also define a few utilities for loading and saving the model.

    train_model(model, train_loader, val_loader=nothing; kwargs...)

Train `model` on the column-wise data with AdamW + (by default) MSE loss, in
whatever space the target was prepared in by the dataloader (e.g. normalised
`log` surface roughness).

Keywords
  * `epochs`, `learning_rate` – max number of epochs and AdamW learning rate.
  * `lossfn`           – any Lux loss with the `(model, ps, st, (x,y))` signature.
  * `ad`               – AD backend, `AutoZygote()` by default.
  * `device`           – `cpu_device()` (default) or `gpu_device()`.
  * `patience`         – early-stopping patience. Training stops once the
                         validation loss has not improved (by more than
                         `min_delta`) for `patience` consecutive epochs, and the
                         best-validation parameters/states are restored. Active
                         only when a `val_loader` is given and `patience > 0`.
  * `min_delta`        – minimum decrease in validation loss that counts as an
                         improvement.
  * `history_path`     – if given, the per-epoch train/validation losses are
                         appended to this CSV file (columns `epoch,train,val`)
                         and flushed every epoch. Robust to crashes/early
                         stopping and ready to `tail -f` or plot *during*
                         training. `nothing` (default) disables the CSV.
  * `rng`, `verbose`.

Returns `(; train_state, ps, st, history, best_epoch, best_val)` where `ps`/`st`
are the trained parameters and the **test-mode** states (the best-validation ones
when early stopping is active, ready to drop into a Lux inference call or the
`LearnedSurfaceRoughness` scheme), and `history` holds per-epoch train/validation
losses.
