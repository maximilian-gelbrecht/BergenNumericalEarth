# # Preprocessing: global NetCDF fields -> column-wise Zarr store prepared for dataloaders
#
# You can savely ignore this file / notebook. This ist just here for completness of the example. 
# We already prepared and preprocessed the data for you. The raw ERA5 files are not saved on the 
# server. Just skip ahead to the next notebook. 
#
 
# ## Preprocessing pipeline
#
#   1. Read the requested variables from one big multi-year NetCDF file, loading only
#      a single year's time-slice into RAM at a time.
#   2. Flatten every field column-wise: each grid point (at each time step) becomes
#      one sample / column.
#   3. Optionally restrict to land via a static land-sea mask (ERA5 `lsm`) — the ocean
#      here is filled with values, not left missing, so it must be masked explicitly.
#   4. Append each chunk's selected columns to a per-variable Zarr array, asserting
#      they hold no NaN/missing rather than silently filtering invalid samples.

Points at one variable `name` inside the NetCDF file at `path`.

`level` selects along the vertical dimension of a 4D (lat, lon, level, time) field:
  * `nothing`  – keep all levels (each level becomes a separate feature),
                 or no-op for a 3D field that has no level dimension,
  * `Integer`  – take a single level, e.g. a surface or bottom-soil index,
  * a range / vector of indices – keep a subset of levels.

`name` doubles as the key the variable is stored under in the Zarr group.

                       landmask_threshold=0.5, overwrite=true, compressor=..., verbose=true)

Build the column-wise dataset from a big multi-year NetCDF file and persist it as a
Zarr group, loading only one year's time-slice into RAM at a time.

Arguments
  * `inputs::Vector{NetCDFVar}` – the predictor variables (land variables).
  * `target::NetCDFVar`         – the target variable (e.g. surface roughness).
  * `zarr_path::AbstractString` – directory store to create.

Memory model
  * `years` is the collection of calendar years to process (e.g. `2000:2020`). The
    CF-decoded `time_name` coordinate is used to find each year's time indices, and
    every variable is read sliced to those indices — so only one year of data is in
    memory at once. With `years=nothing` the whole file is processed in one go.
  * Each year is handled independently in a single pass: load all variables, select
    the land columns (via `landmask`, or all columns if none is given), and append
    them to each variable's Zarr array. Selected columns are asserted to be free of
    NaN/missing before writing — invalid values raise an error rather than being
    silently dropped. Different chunks may contribute different numbers of columns,
    which is fine since samples are stored column-wise.
  * `time_stride` thins the time axis before flattening (keep every `stride`-th
    step; `1` keeps all). The surface fields here are highly redundant in time
    (orography/geopotential is constant, vegetation cover is near-constant, surface
    roughness is quasi-static), so a large stride cuts the sample count — and hence
    the on-disk chunk count — by that factor with little loss. For 3-hourly data:
    `8`≈daily, `56`≈weekly, `240`≈monthly.
  * `landmask` optionally restricts the output to land. This file's variables are
    *filled* (not missing) over the ocean — soil temperature carries SST, vegetation
    and soil moisture are 0, etc. — so the NaN filter alone never drops sea points,
    and no in-file variable cleanly separates land from sea (e.g. deserts look like
    ocean in vegetation/soil moisture). Pass a `NetCDFVar` pointing at a static
    land-sea mask on the same grid (e.g. ERA5 `lsm`, a 0–1 land fraction); columns
    with mask `< landmask_threshold` (default `0.5`) are dropped. The mask is loaded
    once and reused for every timestep.

`chunk_samples` is the chunk width along the sample axis; the Zarr directory store
writes one file per chunk, so the file count is roughly
`(total_samples / chunk_samples) × n_variables`. Keep it large (default `2^22`) and
use `time_stride` to keep `total_samples` modest, or the store explodes into
millions of tiny files. The default `2^22` (~16 MiB chunks) keeps this file at a
few thousand chunk files for typical strides.

Output
  * One array per variable, keyed by `NetCDFVar.name`, of shape `(features,
    n_samples)`, grown year by year, chunked along the sample dimension and
    compressed with `compressor`. Group attributes record `input_names` and
    `target_name`; `n_samples` is simply each array's width.

`compressor` controls on-disk compression (Blosc + zstd by default); pass `nothing`
to store uncompressed. `verbose` logs per-(variable, year) progress and timings.

Assumes all variables share the same `time` axis (same timestamps in the same
order — the usual case for one file).

Returns `(; path, input_names, target_name, n_samples, n_dropped, years)`.
